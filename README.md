# Peas
Autogenerated maze with parkour and minigames, or at least, it's gonna be, but it's not finished

Peas was a game that I jokingly named, it's original plan was to make a game based around P's, literally the letter P. Puns, Puzzles and Parkour, a Pristine Path through the Puzzle Peaks. That was the plan, but as I started I really liked to just get off that path a make a autogenerated maze that would give you the puzzles, parkour and puns. This would make it easier for myself as I'm really bad a leveldesign, something that is obvious when you look at the actual game and it's neon colored floor.

The maze works nowadays, you walk into the grey block that spawns in every room and press E to open another random wall. But if you're able to jump on the parkour part, you'll be able to jump out of the maze. The puzzles don't work yet in the actual level, although you can click on them.

If you find the green coloured room, that's the end, you run into the blue cube and will be redirected to the menu I quickly made in 5 minutes. In this menu you also find the two puzzles that spawn in the maze, but can't play there. These puzzles do work in their respective scenes.

It's not even close to done and I still work on it every day.
